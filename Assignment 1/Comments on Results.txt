# When we increase the range we quantize at, the number of values remaining to represent the image
# decreases so the index map(data matrix) appears darker and more edges appear in the reconstructed
# image after quantization.
# Example: original test image has 67677 colors and after quantizing using a range of 10 the number of
# colors is only 1170, and if we increase the range to 20, the number becomes only 263, and at lastly
# if we increase the range to 30, the number of colors becomes 97.

# Quantization also effect on quality & compression
# Higher quantization => Higher Compression & Lower Quality.
# Lower quantization => Lower Compression & Higher Quality.


#Each result is named with Test_img_with and  of format R: Range , N: range value
# Output of task 1 is the first row of images and output of task 2 is the second row of
# images.
