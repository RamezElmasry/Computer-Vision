If the contrast is too low, it is impossible to distinguish between two objects, and they 
are seen as a single object, and for that histogram equalization is a widely used 
contrast-enhancement technique because of its high eï¬ƒciency and simplicity It modifies 
the dynamic range and contrast of an image by altering that image such that its 
intensity histogram has the desired shape.

Knowing that we can see that in some of the test images, segmenting the equalized counter
part of an image into two classes (Background & Foreground) yeilds better results than 
directly segmenting the original image, as shown in 3,4. While in 1,2 segmenting the 
original image gives better results than their equalized counter parts. However in 5,
despite the equalized enhanced the contrast a bit, it wasnt enough to give better
segmentation than the segmentation from the original due to the large area of close
intensity values in the background.
